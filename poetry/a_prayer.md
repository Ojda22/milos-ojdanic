<h2 align="center">"A Prayer" - by Max Ehrmann</h2>

<div align="center">
<br>
Let me do my work each day; and if the darkened hours of despair overcome me, may I not forget the strength that comforted me in the desolation of other times.<br>
<br>
May I still remember the bright hours that found me walking over the silent hills of my childhood, or dreaming on the margin of a quiet river, when a light glowed within me, and I promised my early God to have courage amid the tempests of the changing years.<br>
<br>
Spare me from bitterness and from the sharp passions of unguarded moments. May I not forget that poverty and riches are of the spirit. <br>
<br>
Though the world knows me not, may my thoughts and actions be such as shall keep me friendly with myself.<br>
<br>
Lift up my eyes from the earth, and let me not forget the uses of the stars.  Forbid that I should judge others lest I condemn myself. <br>
<br>
Let me not follow the clamor of the world, but walk calmly in my path.<br>
<br>
Give me a few friends who will love me for what I am; and keep ever burning before my vagrant steps the  kindly light of hope.<br>
<br>
And though age and infirmity overtake me, and I come not within sight of the castle of my dreams, teach me still to be thankful for life, and for time's olden memories that are good and sweet; and may the evening's twilight find me gentle still.<br>
