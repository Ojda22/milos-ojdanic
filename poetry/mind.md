<h2 align="center">"Salah's" by Milos Ojdanic</h2>

<div align="center">
<br>
 Reach I will you, oh my wild dreams,<br>
 My smile is too wide; my heart is too deep. <br>
 <br>
 Run, hide, escape me try,<br>
 My patience is strong; my will to rest denies.<br>
 <br>
 No matter how long, no matter how far,<br>
 My power is persistence; I will do, I will try.<br>
 <br>
 Life attempts to help you, it scratches ad thorns,<br>
 But be aware of one thing; Samuarai I am sworn.<br>
 <br>
 I have everything for the journey,<br>
 All support and love I need,<br>
 Servalers are always around<br>
 My friends whenever I need.<br>
 <br>
