<h2 align="center">"Invictus: The Unconquerable" by William Ernest Henley</h2>

<div align="center">
<br>
Out of the night that covers me,<br>
      Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br>
I thank whatever gods may be<br>
      For my unconquerable soul.<br>
<br>
In the fell clutch of circumstance<br>
      I have not winced nor cried aloud,<br>
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br>
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br>
<br>
Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br>
      Looms but the horror of the shade,<br>
And yet the menace of the years<br>
      Finds, and shall find me, unafraid.<br>
<br>
It matters not how strait the gate,<br>
      How charged with punishments the scroll,<br>
I am the master of my fate:<br>
      I am the captain of my soul.<br>
<br>
</div>
