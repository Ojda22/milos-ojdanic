At the moment, I'm a Doctorate Candidate at the Luxembourg University, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust [(SnT)](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt). I work in [SERVAL](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) research unit, headed by [Prof. Dr Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon), while being under direct supervision of [Dr Michail (Mike) Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/).

My academic and industrial interests lie in the area of Software Engineering. In particular Software Evolution, Software Testing, Code Analysis, Fault Injection and Intelligent Software Engineering (synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Software Engineering).

I tackle the problems of developing high-quality test cases, identification, prioritization and execution of any tests for any code change at any time. 
My inspiration is to contribute and deliver practical and powerful test environments to software practitioners - by fusing highly assured software, delivered at a reasonable cost, with partial or complete automation to the testers.
