I'm a Data Scientist and Principal Investigator in Goodyear Innovation Center. Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Luxembourg University, Interdisciplinary Centre for Security, Reliability and Trust [(SnT)](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt). I completed my PhD journey in [SERVAL](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/research/serval) research unit (headed by [Prof. Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon)), while being research assistant of [Prof. Michail (Mike) Papadakis](https://mpapad.github.io/).

My academic and industrial interests revolve around the areas of Automated Software Engineering. In particular, Software Evolution, Automated Software Testing, Code Analysis, Fault Injection and various other sub-fields. In a nutshell, Intelligent Software Engineering (synergy between Machine Learning (ML) and Software Engineering) are domains I'm passionate about.

In my research, given a code regression change, I tackled the challenges of developing high-quality test cases, their selection, prioritization, and thoroughness for a source code.
