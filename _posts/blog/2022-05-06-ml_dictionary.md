```Training``` - estimating parameters for machine learning methods using set of data D
```Testing``` - evaluating how well does a method works on new data D' after training

```N-Fold Cross-Validation``` - instead of using only one set D' for testing, lets divide D+D' in N blocks, and perform training N times, while each time using different block from N for testing, and N-1 for training.

```Confusion metrix``` - summary how does a machine learning method algorithm performs. Rows on the matrix corresponds what machine learning algorithm predicted. And columns corresponds to known truth.

```True Possitive``` - Model identifies as correct what is correct
```True Negative``` - Model identifies as negative what is negative
```False Negative``` - Model identifies as negative what is correct
```False Possitive``` - Model identifies as correct what is negative
