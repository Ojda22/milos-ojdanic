### Intro to Machine Learning Testing

Here we will learn overall what is the ML, where do testers fit in machine learning, behavioural testing and how far and responsible AI can be

### What is Machine Learning?

Lets demystify it. Looks at problem embedded in different kind of data, applies different techniques and provides output of the task/problem

ML deals with different kind of problems/tasks. Ofter related to regression, clustering, supervise, unsuprevise, reinforcement, semi- and self-supervised, transfer learning, ensemble learning, federated learning, NLP, Computer Vision and many more

We will look all this from testing perceptive. We need to understand the process of training the model in order to identify the weak spots, suptepible to the biases, errors, and how we can create tests to evaluate thise models before letting them make a mistake into production

The most common application of machine learning, is prediction. The definion, broad definition, of prediction is that we estimate values based on observations (patterns) in already existing values

Example: it is not possible to achive 100% accuracy, so we are dealing with probabilities

Difference with traditional programming:

- traditional programming 
    - input
        - rules
        - data
    - output
        - answers 
- machine learning
    - input
        - data
        - answers
    - output rules(patterns)
    
Terminology: Features(characterization of data), Labels(what we want to predict)

Based on features model learns the rules, to produce the prediction based on a specific input
