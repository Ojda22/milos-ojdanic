title: Different mutation datasets
subtitle: In support of mutation-based testing studies in the context of evolving systems

As part of my PhD research, I conducted experiments that produced several datasets. I believe that making these datasets open-source can benefit practitioners and provide a solid foundation for developing new techniques and conducting thorough studies.

### 💁🏻‍ Dataset of mutants with clean test contracts
 
#### 📄 On the Use of Commit-Relevant Mutants
