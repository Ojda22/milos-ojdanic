### Teaching, Talks and other stuff

Mutation Testing Lecture, [Bachelor Studies, University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/formations/fstm/bachelor_in_applied_information_technology), course by [prof. Dr Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon)

### Experimental Tools and Datasets

[PITAssert](https://github.com/Ojda22/pitest/tree/pit-SOM-RM-AssertCache) - framework for the state of the art mutation testing tool PIT, instrumentation of assertions and hight order mutant creating based on a commit changes.

[JavaPDG](https://github.com/serval-uni-lu/java-pdg) - framework for bytecode graph generation. It generates DefUse chain in aggreation with CotrolFlow graph and Exceptions Controls.

[MutationTestingDataset](https://mutationtesting-user.github.io/evolve-mutation.github.io/) - at the point the biggest collection of mutations. Counts more than 10mil of first and second order of mutations.
