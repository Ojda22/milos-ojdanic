### Teaching, Talks and other stuff

Mutation Testing Lecture, [Bachelor Studies, University of Luxembourg](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/formations/fstm/bachelor_in_applied_information_technology), course by [prof. Dr Yves Le Traon](https://wwwfr.uni.lu/snt/people/yves_le_traon)

### Experimental Tools and Datasets

[PITAssert](https://github.com/Ojda22/pitest/tree/pit-SOM-RM-AssertCache) - Extension framework for the state-of-the-art mutation testing tool PIT - delivers instrumentation of test assertions and generation of high order mutants guided by commit changed statements.

[JavaPDG](https://github.com/serval-uni-lu/java-pdg) - Program for the bytecode graph generation. It generates Definition-Use chains in aggregation with the Control Flow Dependency graph and Throw-Exceptions Execution Controls.

[MutationTestingDataset](https://mutationtesting-user.github.io/evolve-mutation.github.io/) - At this point, the most extensive collection of mutations in code evolution. Counts more than 10mil of the first and second-order mutations.
